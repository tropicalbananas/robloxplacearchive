It appears that the account holding it was hacked in 2017, but the place itself remains unmodified, and can be opened in the March 2007 client. Have Fun!

It's very different from the newest version, using the ID 96623001 but with --ver 2 at the end with f="https://github.com/Modnark/rbxdl/">rbxdl</a></td>, I got the first version of it that wasn't an empty baseplate, which MIGHT be the version you see in the ROBLOX iOS launch video.

This one for some reason isn't in <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/Old-Open-Source-Levels">Roblox/Old-Open-Source-Levels</a></td>, but it would fit right in. Enjoy!

The 2006 Starter Place, looks like in 2010, David Baszucki was bored and decided to make a wreck out of the place, so to fetch this one, I used the ID 1645 but with --ver 1 at the end using <a href="https://github.com/Modnark/rbxdl/">rbxdl</a></td>. The tool's wiki provides more info on how to use it.
