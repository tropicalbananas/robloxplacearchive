It appears that the account holding it was hacked in 2017, but the place itself remains unmodified, and can be opened in the March 2007 client. Have Fun!

</tr>ROBLOX Battle Version 2 | ID 96623001&version=2 | Late 2012</tr>

It's very different from the newest version, using the ID 96623001 but with --ver 2 at the end with </tr><a href="https://github.com/Modnark/rbxdl/">rbxdl</a></td>, I got the first version of it that wasn't an empty baseplate, which MIGHT be the version you see in the ROBLOX iOS launch video.

This one for some reason isn't in <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/Old-Open-Source-Levels">Roblox/Old-Open-Source-Levels</a></td>, but it would fit right in. Enjoy!

This is the 2006 Starter Place, It has a typo in it's name. Looks like in 2010, David Baszucki was bored and decided to make a wreck out of the place, so to fetch this one, I used the ID 1645 but with --ver 1 at the end using <a href="https://github.com/Modnark/rbxdl/">rbxdl</a></td>. The tool's wiki provides more info on how to use it.

</tr><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/1527/Brickyard-v3">Brickyard v3</a></td> | ID 1527 | March 10, 2006</tr>

This one is a flat plate with a bunch of bricks on it, presumably for a building game. IMPORTANT! The bricks are not in workspace, probably due to a mistake made by the designer, so you'll have to copy the bricks into workspace yourself, due to my policy of not modifying the game files other than renaming them to match the name on the website. Easy fix.

Despite being called ROBLOX's Place, it is held by the david.baszucki account. It is a basic brick battle game.
